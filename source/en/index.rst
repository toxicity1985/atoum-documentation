What is atoum?
==============

atoum is a unit test framework like PHPUnit or SimpleTest, but it has a few advantages over these:

* It's modern and uses the innovations of latest PHP versions;
* It's simple and easy to learn;
* It's intuitive because its syntax is close to the English natural language;
* despite constant changes to atoum, backward compatibility is one of the priorities of its developers.

You can find more information on the `official website <http://atoum.org/>`_.
