Asserter & assertion tips
*************************

Several tips & trick are available for the assertion. Knowing them can simplify your life ;)

The first one is that all assertion are fluent. So you can chain them, just look at the previous examples.

You should also know that all assertions without parameter can be written with or without parenthesis.
So ``$this->integer(0)->isZero()`` is the same as ``$this->integer(0)->isZero``.

.. _asserter_tips-alias:

Alias
=====

Sometimes you want to use something that reflect your vocabulary or your domain. atoum provide a simple mechanism, alias.
Here is an example:

.. code-block:: php

	<?php
	namespace tests\units;

	use atoum\atoum;

	class stdClass extends atoum\test
	{
	    public function __construct(adapter $adapter = null, annotations\extractor $annotationExtractor = null, asserter\generator $asserterGenerator = null, test\assertion\manager $assertionManager = null, \closure $reflectionClassFactory = null)
	    {
	        parent::__construct($adapter, $annotationExtractor, $asserterGenerator, $assertionManager, $reflectionClassFactory);

	        $this
	            ->from('string')->use('isEqualTo')->as('equals')
	        ;
	    }

	    public function testFoo()
	    {
	        $this
	            ->string($u = uniqid())->equals($u)
	        ;
	    }
	}

In this example, we create an alias that will create an asserter ``equals`` that will act exactly the same
as ``isEqualTo``. We could also use :ref:`beforeTestMethod<initialization_method>` instead of the constructor. The best is to
create a base class for all the test inside your project that you can extends instead of ``\atoum\test``.

.. _asserter-custom:

Custom asserter
===============

Now that we have seen alias, we can go further by creating a custom asserter. Here is an example of an asserter for credit card.

.. code-block:: php

	<?php
	namespace tests\units;
	use atoum\atoum;

	class creditcard extends atoum\asserters\string
	{
	    public function isValid($failMessage = null)
	    {
	        return $this->match('/(?:\d{4}){4}/', $failMessage ?: $this->_('%s is not a valid credit card number', $this));
	    }
	}

	class stdClass extends atoum\test
	{
	    public function __construct(adapter $adapter = null, annotations\extractor $annotationExtractor = null, asserter\generator $asserterGenerator = null, test\assertion\manager $assertionManager = null, \closure $reflectionClassFactory = null)
	    {
	        parent::__construct($adapter, $annotationExtractor, $asserterGenerator, $assertionManager, $reflectionClassFactory);

	        $this->getAsserterGenerator()->addNamespace('tests\units');
	    }

	    public function testFoo()
	    {
	        $this
	            ->creditcard('4444555566660000')->isValid()
	        ;
	    }
	}

So, like the alias, the best is to create a base class your test and declare your custom asserters there.

.. _asserter_tips-short:

Short syntax
============

With :ref:`alias<asserter_tips-alias>` you can define some intresting things. But because atoum tries to help you in the redaction of your test, we added several aliases.

* **==** is the same as the asserter :ref:`isEqualTo<variable-is-equal-to>`
* **===** is the same as the asserter :ref:`isIdenticalTo<variable-is-identical-to>`
* **!=** is the same as the asserter :ref:`isNotEqualTo<variable-is-not-equal-to>`
* **!==** is the same as the asserter :ref:`isNotIdenticalTo<variable-is-not-identical-to>`
* **<** is the same as the asserter :ref:`isLessThan<integer-is-less-than>`
* **<=** is the same as the asserter :ref:`isLessThanOrEqualTo<integer-is-less-than-or-equal-to>`
* **>** is the same as the asserter :ref:`isGreaterThan<integer-is-greater-than>`
* **>=** is the same as the asserter :ref:`isGreaterThanOrEqualTo<integer-is-greater-than-or-equal-to>`

.. code-block:: php

	<?php
	namespace tests\units;

	use atoum;

	class stdClass extends atoum
	{
	    public function testFoo()
	    {
	        $this
	            ->variable('foo')->{'=='}('foo')
	            ->variable('foo')->{'foo'} // same as previous line
	            ->variable('foo')->{'!='}('bar')

	            ->object($this->newInstance)->{'=='}($this->newInstance)
	            ->object($this->newInstance)->{'!='}(new \exception)
	            ->object($this->newTestedInstance)->{'==='}($this->testedInstance)
	            ->object($this->newTestedInstance)->{'!=='}($this->newTestedInstance)

	            ->integer(rand(0, 10))->{'<'}(11)
	            ->integer(rand(0, 10))->{'<='}(10)
	            ->integer(rand(0, 10))->{'>'}(-1)
	            ->integer(rand(0, 10))->{'>='}(0)
	        ;
	    }
	}
